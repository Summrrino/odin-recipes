    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Gumbo is a hearty stew that’s served hot over rice. It’s a symbol of Louisiana cuisine, but its origins are varied and its history complex. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly flavored stock, meat or shellfish (or sometimes both), a thickener, and the Creole “holy trinity” – celery, bell peppers, and onions. It’s often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether okra or filé powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves). The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. Gumbo is traditionally served with rice. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z’herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens. The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, Spanish, and Native American Choctaw.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a stockpot over medium heat; whisk in flour until roux is smooth and has cooked to the color of chocolate milk, about 8 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn the roux. If you see black specks in the mixture, it's best to start over.</li>
        <li>Add sausage, celery, bell pepper, and onion into the roux; cook and stir 5 minutes. Add garlic; continue to cook and stir another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning; stir well to blend. Pour in chicken broth and add bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chicken and simmer 1 hour more. Skim off any foam that floats to the top during this time.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
