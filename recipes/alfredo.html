    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a classic Italian dish that combines tender, pan-seared chicken with creamy and indulgent Alfredo sauce, served over long strands of fettuccine pasta. The Alfredo sauce, made from butter, minced garlic, nutmeg, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, is reduced on the stovetop until it achieves a creamy consistency that perfectly clings to the pasta. This dish is a dream-team combination of juicy, golden-brown slices of chicken breast and slurp-able strands of thick fettuccine pasta. It’s a rich and satisfying meal that’s sure to impress. Enjoy a bowl of Chicken Alfredo for a taste of authentic Italian cuisine right at home.</p>
